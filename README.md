#### About me
<!---                              ---!>
I'm a FOSS enthusiast with a particular
interest in Linux, live coding (see
usrfriendly/livecode for my setups
across languages/systems), and
electronic music.
usrfriendly/usrfriendly is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
